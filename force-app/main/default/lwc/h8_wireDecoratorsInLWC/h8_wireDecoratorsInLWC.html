<!-- 
 1. To read salesforce data,lightning web components use a reactive wire service. When the wire service provisions data , the component rerenders.
 2. Component use @wire in their JavaScript class to specify a wire adapter or an apex method.
 3. The @wire decorator in LWC is used to read Salesforce data reactively from a server-side Apex method or from Lightning Data Service (LDS). It automatically fetches the data and re-fetches it if the input parameters change — this makes it powerful for building reactive UI components.
 4. for same requirement we can use imperetive method as well which we will see in the next tutorials
 5. The Lightning Data Table in LWC is a base Lightning component (<lightning-datatable>) used to display tabular data with features like sorting, checkbox selection, inline editing, and custom cell rendering. It's highly configurable and optimized for displaying records in a table format.
