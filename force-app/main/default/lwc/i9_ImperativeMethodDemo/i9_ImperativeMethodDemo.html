 1. To control when the method invocation occurs(for example, in response to clicking a button),call the method imperatively.
 2. In LWC (Lightning Web Components), an imperative method refers to a way of calling an Apex method from JavaScript explicitly using a function, rather than wiring it automatically with decorators like @wire.
 Key Characteristics of Imperative Method:
 a) Uses import to bring in the Apex method.
 b) Uses this or a specific user interaction (like a button click) to trigger the call.
 c) Returns a Promise that you handle with .then() and .catch(). 
 
 Promise ? :

 A Promise is like a promise in real life.
“I promise I’ll bring you lemon juice in 5 minutes.”
You don’t have the juice right now, but you will either get it later, or something will go wrong.

In JavaScript, a Promise is used to handle asynchronous code — code that takes time (like fetching data from a server).
We then use .then() to handle the success case.
We use .catch() to handle the error case.
